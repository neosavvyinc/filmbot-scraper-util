DAO Tests
==============

Normally DAO tests should be mocked and stubbed and all that. This go round I am building integration
tests to help make sure we can shuttle data in and out of the database in a way that we need it.

Someday in the future we may circle back and build out more focused unit tests but for now we are going
to go this way.
